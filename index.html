<p>
  <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission
  is to help scientists and engineers become more productive
  by teaching them basic lab skills for computing
  like program design, version control, data management, and task automation.
  This two-day hands-on bootcamp will cover basic concepts and tools;
  participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

<p>
  <strong>What:</strong>
  Our goal is to help scientists and engineers become more productive
  by teaching them basic computing skills like program design, version
  control, testing, and task automation. In this two-day bootcamp,
  short tutorials will alternate with hands-on practical
  exercises. Participants will be encouraged both to help one another,
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems
  during and between sessions. Attendants are offered online office hours:
  regular events to get one-on-one help from Software Carpentry instructors,
  online.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at postgraduate students and other scientists
  who are familiar with basic programming concepts (like loops,
  conditionals, arrays, and functions) but need help to translate this
  knowledge into practical tools to help them work more
  productively.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Content:</strong>
  The syllabus for this bootcamp will include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using the shell to do more in less time.</li>
  <li>Using version control to manage and share information.</li>
  <li>Basic Python programming.</li>
  <li>How (and how much) to test programs.</li>
  <li>Documentation and debugging.</li>
</ul>
